      <p>
        Although the module concerns the introduction of digital health
        literacy, we are going to start by understanding the core element of
        digital health literacy, health literacy. Thus, in the first section, we
        will be looking at the definition of health literacy, antecedents of
        health literacy, its relationship to health outcomes, and related
        skills.
      </p>
      <h2><b>What is health literacy?</b></h2>
      <p>
        The term health literacy is a new concept in health-related studies, and
        only within the last decade have researchers started to discussed
        problems associated with it, the role it plays in an individual’s
        ability to comprehend health-related information, and its relationship
        to health outcomes (Sørensen et al., 2012). Health is not only a new
        concept to health researchers, but some of the health practionners are
        unaware of the health concept, and its importance. However, it is
        important to understand health literacy, because if a person does not
        have adequate health literacy or health-care provider is unaware of the
        person's level of health literacy, it will be difficult to generate
        person-centered health-care (Osborne, 2014).
        <br /><br />
        In the existing literature, health literacy is associated with various
        definitions and interpretations, and they vary based on different health
        domains, including health promotion, health-care, and disease
        prevention. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2013), a
        broad and inclusive definition of health literacy is:
      </p>

      <div class="box">
        <p class="box-quote">
          <em
            >“Health literacy is linked to literacy and entails people’s
            knowledge, motivation and competences to access, understand,
            appraise and apply health information in order to make judgments and
            take decisions in everyday life concerning health care, disease
            prevention and health promotion to maintain or improve quality of
            life during the life course.” (Sørensen et al., 2012; as cited in
            WHO, 2013 pp.4)”.</em

      <h2>Conceptualization of health literacy</h2>
      <p>
        For a practice-oriented understanding of the above definition, the
        European Health Literacy Consortium developed an integrated conceptual
        model of health literacy (Figure 1), which identifies 4 dimensions of
        health literacy related to the ability to accessing, understanding,
        appraising, and applying health-related information. This model
        integrates medical and public views on health literacy. It was developed
        based on a systematic review that counted 17 peer-reviewed definitions
        and 12 previous conceptual frameworks and models of health literacy. As
        you may see, the model also noted the determinants factors and outcomes
        of health literacy (more discussed in the next sub-sections).

          the model shows the four dimensions of health literacy related to
          competencies of accessing, understanding, appraising and applying
          health-related information within health care, disease prevention and
          health promotion settings. The outer parts present the determinants
          factors of health literacy and the pathways to health outcomes.

            Further, the European Health Literacy Consortium combined the four
            dimensions referring to health information processing with the three
            levels of health domains (health-care, disease prevention, and
            health promotion), and this yields a matrix with 12 dimensions of
            health Literacy as it is described in Table 1.

      <h2>Health literacy environment</h2>
      <p>
        WHO (2013) noted that the European Health Literacy Consortium model can
        serve as a basis for developing interventions for improving health
        literacy, and has provided a conceptual basis for developing and
        validating measurement tools, capturing the dimensions of health
        literacy within health care, disease prevention, and health promotion
        settings.
      </p>

      <div class="box">
        <p>
          Although the European Health Literacy Consortium model is important,
          it only conceptualizes health literacy from the perceptive of
          individual abilities and knowledge. However, the range of evidence
          presented supports a wider and relational concept of health literacy
          that considers both individual abilities and knowledge and health
          literacy environment (see, figure 2) (Parker, 2009). 'Health literacy
          environment' is a mix of the infrastructure, policies, processes,
          materials, people and relationships of the health system can be set up
          and work in a way that makes it easier or more difficult for consumers
          to navigate, understand and use information and services about health
          and health care (Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health
          Care, 2014). The way the health literacy environment works, and how
          complex it is influences how individual make decisions and take
          actions about health. Thus, the envision of health literacy
          improvement should consider both individual abilities and the
          environment demands to ensure that people are in the best position to
          make decisions and take action about their health.
