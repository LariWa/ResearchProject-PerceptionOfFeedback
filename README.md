# Enhancing the perception of achieving learning objectives

As part of the course _Human Perception for Information Technology_ at KTH we investigated the impact of different kinds of feedback during online learning. Therefore, we build a simple website using Vue.js. In this project we improved our research and scientific skills.  
The project was conducted from September to October 2021. The group consisted of Bianca Budulacu, Ritty Thomas, Martina Lackov√° and me.

## Abstract

Academic achievement is heavily influenced by motivation to learn. Teachers in many courses strive to motivate students by emphasizing, for
example, the relevance of the learning topic for intrinsic motivation, and encouraging students to produce on time with, for example, extra
points for extrinsic incentive. As a result, we wanted to experiment with different types of motivating nudges in this project by adding
other aspects of perceptions to the learning process.  
Therefore, this paper researches the impact of different kinds of feedback during learning as well as the impact of listening to background
music while studying. An experiment with 15 participants was conducted. The majority of the participants preferred visual or a combination of visual and audio feedback. Regarding the usability, a tendency, that the usability of the visual and the combination of visual and audio feedback is higher was shown. Additionally, the results indicated a tendency that participants listening to no background music were more focused and motivated.
